The IDEs we use to develop C# programs with organize your work in a very specific way. Even though you only really edit the source code file itself, I need the entire structure to open and test your work. So, you'll need to submit a zip file of a complete solution that includes all relevant projects.

So this video is really important. If you get it wrong on the first assignment or two, I'm still going to do my best to grade it, but I'll refer you back to this video or tell you to reach out for help, because once the course gets going I won't have time to figure out submissions that are in the wrong format--and that means I won't grade those submissions.

The exact process for this depends on your operating system and IDE, so I'll show some different variations--you can use the chapter timings in the description below to jump to the relevant example for you. None of this is mean to be a barrier for you, so if you're having trouble just send me an email and let me help

# Visual Studio

When you're ready to submit your work, you'll need to find the folder where you save everything. If you don't remember, you can find it from Visual Studio by right-clicking on the solution and selecting "Open Folder in File Explorer".

Once you've got the folder open, confirm that you're in the right place. You should see a Solution File, and you should see a subfolder for each project in the solution. If you only see one of your projects, you might need to go up a level.

Once you're gotten to the correct spot, I recommend that you close your IDE. This helps ensure that no files will be open or locked when the zip is created.

Use your mouse to select the solution file and all of your project folders, then right click and go to "Send To" and then compressed or zipped folder. 

The name of your zip file doesn't matter much since Canvas is going to rename, but you can call it something that makes sense. Then it's good to move that zip out of your solution folder so you can find it later and so Visual Studio doesn't think it's part of your C# file structure. I usually put it in the Downloads folder, which is easy to find.

Now you can go into canvas and submit that zip file.

Again, if you have trouble the first time, just do your best and I'll help you sort it out. But if you follow these steps, you should be all set.

# Rider

When you're ready to submit work you've completed in Rider, you'll need to find the folder where you save everything. If you don't remember, you can find it from Rider by right-clicking on the solution and selecting "Open In" and then "Finder" or "File Explorer".

Once you've got the folder open, confirm that you're in the right place. You should see a Solution file, and you should see a subfolder for each project in the solution. If you only see one of your projects, you might need to go up a level.

Once you're gotten to the correct spot, I recommend that you close your IDE. This helps ensure that no files will be open or locked when the zip is created.

Use your mouse to select the solution file and all of your project folders, then right click and if you're on Windows go to "Send To" and then compressed or zipped folder. If you're on macOS, you'll right click and select "compress". 

The name of your zip file doesn't matter much since Canvas is going to rename it anyway, but you can call it something that makes sense. Then it's good to move that zip out of your solution folder so you can find it later and so Rider doesn't think it's part of your C# file structure. I usually put it in the Downloads folder, which is easy to find.

Now you can go into canvas and submit that zip file.

Again, if you have trouble the first time, just do your best and I'll help you sort it out. But if you follow these steps, you should be all set.

# VS Code

When you're ready to submit your work, you'll need to find the folder where you save everything. If you don't remember, you can find it from VS Code by right-clicking on the solution and selecting "Reveal in Finder" or "Reveal in File Explorer".

Once you've got the folder open, confirm that you're in the right place. You should see a Solution file, and you should see a subfolder for each project in the solution. If you only see one of your projects, you might need to go up a level.

Once you're gotten to the correct spot, I recommend that you close your IDE. This helps ensure that no files will be open or locked when the zip is created.
