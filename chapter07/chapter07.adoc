There are multiple ways to organize a program, and the code we've written to this point could be described as _procedural programming_.
In procedural programming, we organize our code into methods that perform specific tasks, and we think of a program as a series of tasks that need to be performed in a specific order.
Another popular way to think about software design is _object-oriented programming_ (OOP).
In this chapter, we'll start dip our toes into OOP by learning about _classes_ and _objects_, which are the basic building blocks of OOP.

=== OOP Basics

There's nothing wrong with procedural programming--and, in fact, OOP is a form of procedural programming--but it can get cumbersome as a program grows in size and complexity. And, it isn't always an intuitive way to plan our programs.

Object-oriented programming lets us think about programs the way we think about the world around us.
Instead of thinking about a program as a bunch of tasks, we can think of it as a bunch of *objects* that interact with each other.
As an example, the old-school video game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man[*Pac-Man*] has the main character (an object) moving around a maze (another object), and avoiding four ghosts (yep, four more objects).

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]

image::pac-man.png["Screen shot of Pac-Man gameplay", width=500]

If we decide to create Pac-Man, we'll still be using methods, but they won't be the basic building blocks of our programs.
Instead, we'll be organizing our programs into *classes*, which are blueprints--or recipes--for creating objects.
A class defines the *attributes* and *behaviors* of the objects--and those are the variables and methods we'll write to create our programs.

==== Class Diagrams
In OOP, our planning for a program starts by deciding what objects--and therefore, what classes--we'll need in order to implement the functionality we want.
To help organize our thinking, we'll use a tool called a *class diagram*, which gives a visual representation of the classes and their relationships in our program.
The format programmers use for class diagrams is called _Unified Modeling Language_ (UM)). 
The UML standards are extensive, and we'll be using a simplified version in this course. 

Consider a program that tracks inventory at a comic book shop. A simple class to represent one comic book might look like this:

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A class diagram for a restaurant order
// image::OrderDiagram-crt-green.png["Class diagram for the `Order` class"]
// image::OrderDiagram.png["Class diagram for the `Order` class"]
// Image can be rendered at plantuml.com if necessary.
[plantuml, target="ComicBookDiagram", format=png]
----
// !theme crt-green // delete for light theme
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class ComicBook
{
   -title:string
   -issueNum:int
   -price:double
   +void sell()
   +void buy()
   +printReceipt()
} 
@enduml
----

The top section of the diagram has the name of the class, which is `ComicBook`.

The next section is for the attributes of the class--the information the class will store. This example has attributes for the title of the comic book, the issue number, and the price.

The bottom section is for the behaviors of the class, which are the actions the class can perform (or that we can do with the class).
With a comic book, we might sell it to a customer, buy it from a customer, or print a receipt.

We'll learn more about the symbols and conventions of UML as we go along, but for now the important part is that we can use class diagrams to help us plan our programs--and to talk about OOP concepts without bogging down on code details.

// TODO: add Lucid to Canvas navigation
NOTE: Your Canvas course includes access to *Lucid (Whiteboard)*, which is a free online tool you can use to create UML diagrams. If you create your account through the link in the left-hand navbar in Canvas, you'll have access to the premium features for free.

=== Encapsulation

Object-oriented programming is all about creating objects that can interact with each other.
Since the objects will be interacting, we need to think about how to keep them from interfering with each other in ways we don't want.
If we have a `ComicBook` class in a program used by a shop, we don't want some other class to change attributes in a way that disrupts the program--like setting the price to zero, or making the issue number a negative number, for example.

To prevent this kind of tampering, whether it's intentional or accidental, OOP relies on a concept called *encapsulation*.
Encapsulation of a class means that attributes are hidden from the outside world, and only the behaviors of the class can access and change them.
For another analogy, consider a vending machine. 
We can't just reach in and grab a candy bar; we have to pay and use the buttons on the machine.
In this analogy, the snacks are encapsulated and we can only access them by using a behavior, like "buy candy".

Another way to think of encapsulation is the way we interact with other people in social situations.
When we encounter a stranger, they don't automatically know our name and phone number; they have to ask us for that information.
We've encapsulated our personal information, and we only share it when and how we choose to.

IMPORTANT: In C#, encapsulation is not a strict requirement, and our code will still work if we don't use it.
But it's a best practice--and an important one--so we will encapsulate all of our classes in this course.

=== Defining and Using a Class

We'll look at a program to keep rudimentary swimming pool maintenance records; for a single day's data, we'll have a class called `PoolRecord`.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.Class diagram for the `PoolRecord` class
// Image can be rendered at plantuml.com if necessary
[plantuml, target="PoolRecordDiagram", format=png]
----
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class PoolRecord 
{
   -date:string
   -waterTemp:int
   -phLevel:double
   +setDate(string):void
   +setWaterTemp(int):void
   +setPhLevel(double):void
   +displayData():void
}
@enduml
----

To implement this class in code, we'll start with a class header. The class header always follows the same pattern: an *access modifier*, the keyword `class`, and the name of the class.
The class header is followed by a code block, enclosed in curly braces.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.`PoolRecord.cs`. A class header and code block. 
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public class WeatherRecord 
{

   // class code goes here

}
----

Access modifier:: The `public` keyword means that the class can be accessed from any other class. Though this is technically optional, we should always use `public` for now.
`class` keyword:: The keyword that tells Java we're defining a class. It's required. We'll eventually be able to create different kinds of classes and OOP structures, but for now we're just creating regular classes.
*Class name* (or _identifier_):: The name of the class, which should be a noun that describes the object the class represents--and is singular, so there's no _s_ at the end. The identifier should start with a capital, with the first letter of each word capitalized (like `WeatherRecord`). This is similar to the _camelCase_ naming convention we've been using for variables, and it's the same convention we've been using for methods; it's called _PascalCase_.

The class code block is where we define the different components that make up the class, which we call the *instance members*. 
For now, we'll focus on two types of instance members: *fields* and *methods*.

==== Fields

*Fields* are the implementation of the _attributes_ of the class.
They are also known as *instance variables* because they are similar to the variables we've been using in our programs, but their <<_variable_scope,scope>> is the object created from the class, not the method where they're defined.
A field is unique to the object; if we make two objects from our `WeatherRecord` class, each object will have its own date, high temperature, and average temperature.
// If we change the high temperature for one object, it won't affect the high temperature for the other object.

Fields are declared like our other variables, but they are encapsulated using the `private` access modifier.
This means that the fields can only be accessed and changed by the methods of the class, not by other classes--which controls how the data is used and prevents accidental or invalid changes.

WARNING: Since a class will compile and run even if we leave off the `private` access modifier, it's easy to forget to use it. But don't worry, I'll help you remember by taking huge points off your assignments if you don't make your fields `private`. As I've mentioned, you're not really doing OOP if you don't encapsulate your fields, and we're learning OOP here.

// Fields are declared at the top of the class using the same naming conventions we've been using for variables: a descriptive name formatted in camelCase.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.`WeatherRecord.cs`. Fields added to the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public class WeatherRecord 
{
   private string date;
   private int highTemp;
   private int avgTemp;
}
----

In our original class diagram, we indicated that the fields were private by using a `-` in front of the field name.

image::WeatherRecordDiagram.png["Class diagram for the `WeatherRecord` class"]

image::SadPuppy.png["Sad puppy", width=200, float=right] 

You might remember from <<_variable_scope,the section on variable scope in Chapter 0011>> that using global variables is terrible, and every time we create a global variable, a puppy loses its favorite toy. 
And these fields look an awful lot like global variables.
But fields in a class are *not* global variables; they're *instance* variables, and that's a good thing.
The fields are *encapsulated*, so they can only be accessed and changed by the methods of the class--which is also good thing.
And the fields are unique to each object, so we can have multiple objects with different values for the fields--which is yet another a good thing.
And so no puppies' toys will be harmed as long as we use *private* fields correctly.

==== Methods

Ensuring that our fields are `private` is the first step in encapsulating our class, but it's not the only step.
We also need to create methods that can access and change the fields--otherwise, the fields are useless.
So far, our methods have included the keyword `static`; we'll learn more about that shortly, but when we make methods for an OOP class, we'll leave off that `static` keyword.
These _nonstatic_ methods are called *instance methods*, and they are otherwise very similar to the `static` methods we've been using.

Though there are exceptions, most of these instance methods will be `public`, so they can be accessed from other classes.
Remember, the foundation of encapsulation is having `private` fields and `public` methods to permit interactions with that data.

In broad terms, we can categorize instance methods into two types: *accessor* methods and *mutator* methods.

===== Accessor Methods

Accessor methods give access to the fields of the class, but they don't change the fields.
Think of them as "read only" methods, and often all they do is return the value of a field.
Java naming conventions specify that accessor methods should start with `get` and then the name of the field they access, formatted in camelCase. 
Because of that convention, another name for accessor methods is *getters*.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.An accessor method (or "getter")
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public int getHighTemperature()
{
        return highTemperature;
}
----

The return type of an accessor method is the same as the type of the field it accesses; in this case `highTemperature` is an `int`, so the return type of our getter is `int`.

A getter allows other classes to be able to read the value of a field; if they don't need to know the value, we just don't write a getter for that field.
But read-only access usually does no harm, so often we'll have getters for all of our fields.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.`WeatherRecord.cs`. Getters added to the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public class WeatherRecord 
{
   private string date;
   private int highTemp;
   private int avgTemp;

   public string getDate()
   {
      return date;
   }

   public int getHighTemp()
   {
      return highTemp;
   }

   public int getAvgTemp()
   {
      return avgTemp;
   }
   
}
----

===== Mutator Methods

Mutator methods change the fields of the class.
Though they sometimes return a value, their primary purpose is to change the value of a field and they often have a `void` return type.
As we're getting the hang of this OOP thing, we'll create a lot of mutator methods that are just *setters*--methods that set the value of a field.
The naming convention for setters is to start with `set` and then the name of the field they change, formatted in camelCase; they usually have a void return type.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public void setHighTemperature(int temp)
{
    highTemperature = temp;
}
----

The parameter of a setter is the same type as the field it changes; in this case `highTemperature` is an `int`, so the parameter of our setter is also an `int`.
All this method does is accept a new value and assign it to the field.

Choosing to write setters isn't quite as straightforward as with getters, where there's generally no harm in exposing read-only access to everything.
But we really should only write setters for fields that we want to be able to change from outside the class.

TIP: A rule of thumb for beginners: create *getters* for all of your fields when you first write your class, and then add *setters* only as you need them. Because this is sometimes tricky for beginners to determine, I don't deduct points for writing unnecessary setters--but sometimes my directions will explicitly tell you not to write a setter for a field, and I do deduct for that.

If you're paaying attention to what we're doing here, you might be thinking that these setters really just give public access to the fields, which seems to go against the whole idea of encapsulation.
That's true for now, but only because we're starting with some basic examples.
As we get the hang of this OOP stuff, we'll write more complex methods that can control *how* fields are changed--for example, by using `if` statements checkto check that a new value is valid and won't break anything.
But for now, this is just another one of those frustrating rules that you just have to follow because your teacher is unreasonable.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.`WeatherRecord.cs`. Setters added to the `WeatherRecord` class, and comments identifying the parts.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public class WeatherRecord 
{
    // Fields
    private string date;
    private int highTemperature;
    private double averageWindSpeed;
    
    // Getters
    public string getDate()
    {
        return date;
    }

    public int getHighTemperature()
    {
        return highTemperature;
    }

    public double getAverageWindSpeed()
    {
        return averageWindSpeed;
    }

    // Setters and Mutators
    public void setDate(string date)
    {
        this.date = date;
    }

    public void setHighTemperature(int highTemperature)
    {
        this.highTemperature = highTemperature;
    }

    public void setAverageWindSpeed(double averageWindSpeed)
    {
        this.averageWindSpeed = averageWindSpeed;
    }
}
----

Sometimes mutator methods don't follow the exact pattern and purpose of setters (simply setting a field's value).
For example, a method might perform a series of calculations and changes to multiple fields, or it might change a field based on the value of another field.
These methods are still mutators, and we might even still refer to them as _setters_, but they don't always follow the `setFieldName` naming convention.

Designing an OOP Class

==== Using the Class
As we've learned, defining a class establishes a blueprint; to make use of a class in a program, we need to use that blueprint to create an object. 
We can as many objects from a class as we need, and each object is known as an *instance* of the class.
And creating an instance is called *instantiating* a class.

To create our first objects, we use the same two steps we've been using to create variables: a declaration statement and an assignment statement.
The declaration is still a _data type_ and an _identifier, but in this case the data type is the name of the class:

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A declaration statement for an object.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
WeatherRecord day1;
----

This creates a variable called `day1` that will point to (or _reference_) the memory location where our object will be stored.
The identifier follows the same rules we learned for primitive variables: a descriptive name typed in camelCase (with a lowercase first letter).
In this case, the `day1` object is going to maintain the record for the first day of our weather tracking.

The assignment statement works the same, but what we're assigning looks a lot different.
We'll use the `new` keyword to allocate memory, and then we'll call a *constructor*.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.An assignment statement for a newly declared object.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
WeatherRecord day1;
day1 = new WeatherRecord();
----

We're soon going to spend time learning about constructors, but here are the takeaways for now: the identifier is exactly the same as the class name, and it's followed by parentheses.

NOTE: We've already learned that parentheses in C# *always* means we're referring to a method. A constructor is a special method called when instantiating an object.

Just like with variables, we often combine those two statements into one line of code:

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A combined declaration and instantiation statement.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
----

Now that we have an object, we can call its instance methods using _dot notation_, which means we put the object name (*not* the class name!), followed by a dot, followed by the method call:

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.Instance method calls using dot notation.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
day1.setHighTemperature(87);
Console.WriteLine("High temperature on day 1:" + day1.getHighTemperature());
----

In this example, we're setting the `highTemperature` field of `day1` to 87 degrees, and then we're retrieving the high temperature and outputting the returned value.
This is a good test of the _set_ and _get_ methods for the `highTemperature` field.

It's easy for beginners to forget to use that dot notation.
To see why it's necessary, consider the following example.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.Instance method calls on multiple objects.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
WeatherRecord day2 = new WeatherRecord();

day1.setHighTemperature(87);
----

If we left off the `day1.` part of the call, the compiler would not know which `setHighTemperature()` method to use, `day1` or `day2`.
And even when we only have one instance, the compiler needs to know where to find that method, so the dot notation is required every time we call an instance method.

===== Object Classes vs. Driver Classes

Ok, time for another convention that seems only intended to be nitpicky and pointless, but is important and is expected on assignments in this course.
OOP nerds value keeping the different parts of our programs compartmentalized, and that includes separating the class definition from the code that uses the class.
A class we define for use as object can be called an *object class* or a *user-defined class*. 

The code that uses the _object class_ should be in its own class, and is often called a *driver class*.
The driver class contains the `Main()` method, which is the entry point for the program.
A driver class actually goes by several different names. 
Some people call it a _main class_ because, well, it's the class with the `Main()` method; I don't hear that term a lot, but it is out there.
I often use the terms _demo class_ or _test class_ because, as learners, we're often making a class just to try a specific concept or skill, and the only thing our program really does is show that the object class is working. 
And in those cases, we often see "test" or "demo"; so a driver class for our `WeatherRecord` object class might be called `WeatherRecordDemo` or `TestWeatherRecord`, or something similar.

The point here is that, if we've created an object class called `WeatherRecord`, we're not going to put our `Main()` method in that same class/file.
We're going to make a separate class--a driver, or demo class, or test class.
I don't much care what term you use, as long as it's a separate class.

Your pitchforks are already sharpened, but here's the part where you light your torches.
*All of your input and output should be in the driver class.*
That is, you generally can't have any `Write()`, `WriteLine()`, or ReadLine() statements in your object classes.
My examples always demonstrate this _separation of concerns_, so you'll have plenty of examples of what I mean.

.Interesting!
****

I asked an AI platform to give me an image of an angry mob with pitchforks and torches (coming after me because I make them separate their input and output), and the AI spit out this link:{imagesdir}/creepy_mob.png[nightmare fuel^]. 
I decided it was too creepy to display in the text, but this crime against nature should be preserved for posterity. If a mob like that comes for me, I'll let them put `Write()` statements wherever they want!
****

Why can't we put input/output in our object classes?
* To "decouple" the UI from the _business logic_ or guts of our program. This makes our code reusable in a variety of projects, such as web pages, mobile apps, and GUI applications--none of which are friendly to console input and output. Look up MVC and MVVM for all kinds of information about that.
* To keep our code more readable by keeping the parts clearly identifiable.
* Because I just don't care much about input and output. I care about the classes you create, so I want to look at (and grade) that work separately. If your input and output don't work but your object class looks good, you're still going to get a good grade--if I'm able to separate out those mistakes.

Unfortunately, this is one of those things that boils down to, "because I said so" and "you'll thank me later."
Sorry, I can't do much better than that for now.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]

        WeatherRecord day2 = new WeatherRecord();

        // Set field values for both instances
        day1.setDate("2024-10-01");
        day1.setHighTemperature(87);
        day1.setAverageWindSpeed(1.5);

        day2.setDate("2024-10-02");
        day2.setHighTemperature(75);
        day2.setAverageWindSpeed(8.25);

        // Output field values for both instances
        Console.WriteLine("Date: " + day1.getDate());
        Console.WriteLine("High Temperature: " + day1.getHighTemperature());
        Console.WriteLine("Average Wind Speed: " + day1.getAverageWindSpeed());

        Console.WriteLine("------------------------------");

        Console.WriteLine("Date: " + day2.getDate());
        Console.WriteLine("High Temperature: " + day2.getHighTemperature());
        Console.WriteLine("Average Wind Speed: " + day2.getAverageWindSpeed());
    }
}
----

The driver class above creates two instances of the `WeatherRecord` class, uses each setter, then outputs the return from each getter.
This ensures that instance variables are independent of each other and all instance methods work correctly.
In general, I ask students to create at least two instances of each class they are demonstrating.

IMPORTANT: The Lab Assignments in Canvas can be completed using what we've covered to this point. You might choose to complete that work now, then move onto the next section--which you'll need for the Programming Project.

=== Constructors
When we instantiate a new object, the syntax includes a call to a method, immediately following the `new` keyword:

`WeatherRecord day1 = new *WeatherRecord()*;`

This is a call to a special method called a *constructor*.
A constructor runs when an object is instantiated, and it's used to set up the object with any initial values or behaviors.
A constructor's primary job is to initialize the fields of the object--to give each instance variable a value.
If we don't write a constructor, the compiler will create one for us; it's called a default constructor, and it will set all fields to their default values.
For example, numeric fields like `int` and `double` will be set to zero, and `string` fields will be set to `null`.
We've been using setters to change those initial values to what we want, but we can also write our own constructors to set those values when the object is created.

Constructors are a special kind of method, so their syntax is a little different from other methods.
A constructor is always public, it has no return type (not even `void`), and its name is the same as the class name.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A constructor definition for the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public WeatherRecord()
{
    // code to initialize fields goes here
}
----

The most important job of a constructor is setting values for each field of the object.
As a beginner, our rule of thumb is to just make a simple assignment statement for each field.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A constructor that initializes fields.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public WeatherRecord()
{
    this.date = "2025-01-01";
    this.highTemperature = 0;
    this.averageWindSpeed = 0.0;
}
----

Since our `WeatherRecord` class has three fields, we've got three assignment statements in our constructor.
We can initialize those fields to any value we want, but we should choose values that make sense for the object; whatever we put there will be the default values that each object gets when it is instantiated.

Constructors should be written at the top of the class, before the fields and methods.

NOTE: This constructor is called a *parameterless* constructor because it doesn't have any parameters in the parentheses. It's technically *not* a default constructor, because we wrote it ourselves rather than letting the compiler do it, but so many people call it a default constructor that the term is used more often than _parameterless constructor_.

Constructors can also have parameters, which allows us to pass values to the constructor when we instantiate an object.
This is useful when we want to set the initial values of the fields to something specific, rather than the default values.
We add parameters to our constructor just like we do with any other method, by listing the data type and identifier in the parentheses.

[caption="Example {chapter-number}.{counter:source-counter} - "]
.A constructor with parameters.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public WeatherRecord(string date)
{
    this.date = date;
    this.highTemperature = 0;
    this.averageWindSpeed = 0.0;
}
----

To use this constructor, we pass a `string` value when we instantiate the object:

`WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord("1998-01-25");`

There are a couple of important things to note about this example:

1. This constructor only has one parameter but it still has three assignment statements. All fields need values, so if we don't have a parameter to get a field's value, we need to set it to a default value.

2. The parameter has the same name as the field: `date`. This is a common practice, but it's potentially confusing.
And it also violates guidance I gave you when we learned about <<_variable_scope,variable scope>>.

In this case, the parameter is a _local variable_ to the constructor, and it's _shadowing_ the field. Our assignment statement needs to be carefully written: `this.date` refers to the field, and `date` refers to the parameter.

We can also <<_overloading_a_method,overload>> constructors, which means we can have multiple constructors with different parameters--just like we can with any other method.
That can include having a parameterless constructor and one or more constructors with parameters, or having multiple constructors with different numbers of parameters.

==== Constructors and Encapsulation

Constructors allow us to be stricter with our encapsulation since now we don't have to have setters to put data into our objects. 
We can provide a constructor to accept all the data the object needs, decide if we give access to change a field after the object has been instantiated.

For example, if we're making a bank account object, we'd need to provide an account number when we create the account, but we probably shouldn't allow the account number to be changed after the account is created. 
In that case, our constructor would accept the account number, but we wouldn't provide a setter for the account number.


// TODO: RESUME HERE and review idea of static constants
=== `static` Methods and Constants

Since we first started learning about <<_0011_methods,methods>>, we've been using the `static` keyword as part of those definitions. 
And though you're probably using <<_first_c_program,top-level statements>> in your programs, we've also seen the `static` keyword in front of the `Main()` method when we create a program the "old fashioned" way.
However, we haven't had enough context to understand what that keyword means.

With objects, we've learned about _instance members_, which are the fields and methods that belong to an object.
Fields are instance variables, which means that each object has its own copy of the field that can be changed without affecting other objects.
Instance methods are the code that an object can run, and they can access and change the fields of the object.
Instance members are defined *without* using the `static` keyword, so we refer to them as _nonstatic_ members.

When we use the `static` keyword, we're creating a _class member_--a field or method that belongs to the class itself, not to any object created from the class.
Put another way, a class member is shared by all objects created from the class, and it can be accessed without even creating an object.

`Console` is a class that includes the `Write()` and `WriteLine()` methods we've been using, and they are class methods declared with the  `static` keyword.
Since they're `static`, we can call them without creating a `Console` object:

[source,csharp]
----
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
----

If `WriteLine()` was an instance method (without the `static` keyword), we'd have to create a `Console` object before we could call it:

----
Console myConsole = new Console();    // Don't do this!
myConsole.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // It's not necessary!
----

That would be a pain, so we're glad that `WriteLine()` is `static`.

In C#, when we create a <<_declaring_constants,constant>> (using the `const` keyword), that constant is implicitly (automatically) static, so we don't include the `static` keyword.
When we put a constant in an object class, we're creating a value that is shared by all objects created from the class.
If we have a savings account class, a common example when learning OOP, we might have a constant for the interest rate. 
This would mean that every savings account would earn the same interest rate, which is often how banks work.

.`SavingsAccount.cs`. A class with a `static` constant.
[source,csharp,linenums]
----
public class SavingsAccount 
{
    public const double INTEREST_RATE = 0.02;

    // other fields and methods go here. See the repository for the complete code.

    public void AddInterest()
{
        balance += balance * INTEREST_RATE;
    }

}   
----

.Interesting!
****
C# also has a `readonly` keyword, which is similar to `const`, but it allows us to set the value of the constant in a constructor. In other words, can can define a constant but set the value at runtime. That's beyond our scope here, but you can https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly[read about it^] if you're interested.

// === Programming Paradigms
// TODO: Move "programming paradigm" content to the chapter on oop?
// This was removed from Chapter 1.

// NOTE: THIS CONTENT HAS BEEN UPDATED A LITTLE IN SKIMPY-OOP!

// A paradigm is a model or example, or maybe better described as a way of seeing things--which is helpful to think about, since we can all have different ways of seeing how a problem could be solved.

// Imagine that your crazy uncle wants to pay you to go through the junk in his garage and organize his giant collection of vinyl records. 
// Or imagine it's a collection of books, if that's what you prefer.
// How would you organize the collection? 
// You could group them by artist and then arrange them alphabetically, from https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s?si=2N4W5250-YP5Pdth[ABBA] to https://youtu.be/F2HH7J-Sx80?si=ByL5Vr4VVYmDA8Rv[Warren Zevon].
// Or you could group them by genres (keeping disco separate from rock \'n' roll), or just put them in the order they were released.

// There are tons of different ways to do it. 
// None of them are really right or wrong, it just depends on what you prefer--or maybe on how you plan to find things later. 
// Coding is similar, in that we all have different ways we imagine organizing a program or solving a problem. 
// That's kinda the idea of a programming paradigm: how do you think about the program you're creating? 
// How do you picture it being organized?

// Just like programming languages, paradigms are numerous. 
// In fact, some languages were created specifically to work well with a certain paradigm, and that's one reason there are so many languages. 
// But when someone is going to learn to code, there are often two paradigms we consider:

// * Procedural Programming
// * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

// They have a lot in common, and in fact, OOP is actually a type of procedural programming.
// Programmers love to argue why one approach is better than the other, in the same way some of my friends might argue about Ford trucks vs. Chevy trucks.
// And just like Ford vs. Chevy, there's nothing inherently better about one paradigm or the other--sorry friends, but Ford and Chevy trucks are basically the same.
// Growing up, my own first coding experiences were exclusively with procedural programming, and I stayed in that world until I began teaching Java--now I very much prefer OOP, both for my own programming and for teaching beginning coders.
// But that really is a personal preference, and I wouldn't argue that OOP is _better_ than procedural programming.

// Well, I wouldn't argue _much_. 

// ==== Comparing Procedural Programming and OOP

// In procedural programming, we break up a program into the tasks we need to complete. 
// Each individual task is handled by a set of statements that we call a *procedure*. 
// If we need to calculate a student's overall course grade, for example, we write a procedure to do it.

// The data for our program--the stuff we're keeping track of--is stored somewhere else. 
// If a procedure needs something to complete its task, that data is sent to the procedure, which then sends back a result. 
// In short, information is kept separate from the code that uses it and is passed back and forth as necessary.

// .Passing data in procedural programming
// image::ProceduralProgramming.png[Diagram of data passing in procedural programming, 400]

// Many programming languages (including Python) refer to procedures as *functions*, and the term *subroutines* is also used in some cases; if you've done some programming in any language, you've almost certainly used procedures in some form.

// In OOP, the focus shifts from procedures to *objects*, which are programming elements that bundle data with the procedures that use it, instead of keeping them separate.
// We'll explore the nature of objects in great detail going forward, so we won't worry about describing it too much for now.

// I have my own biases about the topic.
// I tend to think OOP lends itself especially well to things like graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games, as well as large projects developed by teams of programmers.

// The bottom line is that, when faced with a programming task or project, my brain immediately starts thinking in terms of the _objects_ the program will need.
// But that's probably just a matter of habit; as I mentioned, I spent much of my life (including all of the time I spent as a professional programmer) seeing programs as a bunch of procedures. 

// In this course, we'll focus on procedural programming early on, but we'll learn the basics of OOP later on.
