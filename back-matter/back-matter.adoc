=== Sample answers to "Check Yourself..." questions

These review questions are intended to be a little open-ended, so your answers will vary.
Many of the sample answers in this section are adapted from responses generated by Copilot in mid-2025, using the https://copilot.microsoft.com[web interface].
Unfortunately, I didn't take careful notes on which responses I used as I was experimenting with Copilot and only expected to use the material as a placeholder until I wrote my own.
It turned out that the Copilot responses were pretty good.

==== Getting Started Chapter

[qanda]
*What tools do you need to develop C# programs?*::
You'll need an IDE and the .NET SDK.

*What does IDE stand for and what is it's role in software development?*::
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's the software you'll use to write your C# code.

*What IDE did you choose? Why?*::
Anything is fine, as long as it supports C#! Popular choices include Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider.


==== Computers and Coding

[qanda]
*What is the primary role of a programming language in the context of computer programming?*::
The primary role of a programming language is to act as a bridge between human language and machine language. It allows humans to write instructions in a way that is easier for them to understand and use, which can then be accurately translated into machine language that a computer can execute.

*Explain the difference between compiled and interpreted programming languages. Provide an example of each.*::
   - *Compiled languages* are those where the source code is translated into machine language by a compiler before the program is run. This machine language file can then be executed directly by the computer. An example of a compiled language is C.
   - *Interpreted languages* are those where the source code is translated into machine language on the fly, as the program is running, by an interpreter. An example of an interpreted language is Python.
   - *Java* is a unique case as it is both compiled and interpreted. The source code is first compiled into an intermediate language called bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) at runtime.

*What are the key steps in the software development process as outlined in the chapter? Why is it important to follow these steps?*::
   - The key steps in the software development process are:
     - *Analysis*: Identifying the goals and scope of the program. This step ensures that you understand what the program needs to do.
     - *Testing Plan*: Determining how the final program will be tested. This step ensures that you have a clear understanding of how to verify that the program works correctly.
     - *Implementation*: Writing and testing the code iteratively. This step involves developing the program piece by piece, testing each part to ensure it works before moving on to the next.
     - *Revise or Maintain*: Updating the program as needed based on changing requirements or ensuring it continues to perform as expected over time.
   - Following these steps is important because it helps keep the development process organized and focused, ensures efficient use of time, and makes complex programming tasks more approachable.
